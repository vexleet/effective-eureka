# Effective Eureka

A project where I'm trying to recreate vue reactivity without reading the source code.

This is just a simple project to understand more behind the scenes of Vue and also me playing around and improve myself

I would like to look at implementing Virtual DOM and other stuff that Vue provides and maybe create a TODO app.

Overall I'm currently happy that I managed to understand how things works under the hood even if I havent added any edge cases and etc.

P.S. Project name is generated using GitHub name suggestion when creating a new repo and this sounded fun
